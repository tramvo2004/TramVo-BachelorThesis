# High-Value Target Detection & Enhanced ALE Calculation

## Project description

The process of this project contains two main parts. The first part focuses on evaluating the risk associated with each asset and accurately determining its value, recognizing that not all assets contribute equally to operational continuity. Based on the result from the first part, the second part involves calculating Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE), which aims to create a more precise estimation of the potential financial impact of cyber incidents. Probabilistic graphical models will be applied as they offer a structured and probabilistic approach to modelling the complex interdependencies among assets, vulnerabilities, and risk factors in (Operational Technology) OT environments. The research aims at testing the accuracy and feasibility of applying probabilistic graphical models, not only in detecting high-value assets but also in assessing assetsâ€™ value and expected loss.
